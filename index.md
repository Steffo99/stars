Hi! Welcome to my experimental media ratings website!

Everything you see here is very much a work in progress, ratings included, as I'm still figuring out what's the most fun way to share with the world what I like and what I don't!

## Ratings

Ratings go from 1 to 100, and ***aren't*** intended in the scholastic way of "anything below 60 is a failure"!

If anything, media scoring 35 or more are media I've enjoyed, in a way or another, which should be considered a success by the authors!
