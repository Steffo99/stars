Hi! Welcome to my experimental media ratings website!

Everything you see here is very much a work in progress, as I'm still figuring out what's the most fun way to share what I like and what I don't!

## Ratings

Ratings go from 1 to 100, and ***aren't*** intended in the scholastic way of "anything below 60 is a failure"!

If anything, media scoring 35 or more are media I've enjoyed, in a way or another, which should be considered a success by the authors!

Also, since this website is a work in progress, ***ratings are still provisional***, and might change at any time, especially until I'm done rating everything!
